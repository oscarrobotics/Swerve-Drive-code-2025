This is the code for a robot named lobster, which will be used for the FRC 2025 season by team 832

Goals / things we need to code and implement:
-Autonomous runs
-Control of the elevator in levels
-Intake and outtake with the claw motor
-Motorized wrist pivot for the claw (maybe code it so it only holds 2 or 3 positions?)
-Photon vison
-More complicated autonomous

By the time we make it to Gainesville, we should have this done.

I've never written a README before, so tell me if theres anything integral I need to add. 

Comment your code!
